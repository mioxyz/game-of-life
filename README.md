# Game Of Life Unit Test Demo
Is a minimal implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), 
a cellular automation algorithm for demonstrating how unit tests work in C#.
This is an old project imported from [my gitlab account](https://gitlab.com/mioxyz/game-of-life-2).

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
